# vtune-api-wrappers
Provide convenience wrappers for VTune suspend/resume and task APIs

The reason of existence of this project is that using the VTune API for suspend and resume, and using tasks is slightly cumbersome. These wrappers provide a RAII style for suspend/resume and task functionality.
